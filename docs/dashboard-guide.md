pip install plotly pandas numpy

# Run the dashboard
streamlit run dashboard_app.py
```

### Configuration
The dashboard uses the same AWS OpenSearch configuration as your main application:
- `AWS_HOST`: Your OpenSearch domain endpoint
- `AWS_REGION`: AWS region
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: AWS access key
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: AWS secret key
- `AWS_SERVICE`: Service name (usually 'es')

## Dashboard Navigation

- **Storage Optimization**: Identify opportunities to reduce index size

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Connection Problems
- **Symptom**: "Failed to connect to OpenSearch"
- **Solution**: Verify AWS credentials and network connectivity
- **Check**: Environment variables, security groups, VPC settings

#### Performance Issues
- **Symptom**: Slow dashboard loading or timeouts
- **Solution**: Check OpenSearch cluster resources and scaling
- **Monitor**: CPU, memory, and disk usage on OpenSearch nodes

#### Data Not Appearing
- **Symptom**: Empty charts or missing metrics
- **Solution**: Ensure documents are indexed and index exists
- **Verify**: Run searches in main app first, check index health

### Performance Optimization Tips
1. **Refresh Frequency**: Use auto-refresh judiciously to avoid overloading cluster
2. **Query Optimization**: Dashboard performs multiple aggregation queries
3. **Cluster Sizing**: Ensure adequate resources for both app and dashboard usage
4. **Monitoring**: Use dashboard insights to optimize search application

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- **AWS IAM**: Dashboard uses same credentials as main application
- **Network Security**: Ensure proper VPC and security group configuration
- **Data Privacy**: Dashboard shows aggregated metrics, not document content

### Best Practices
1. **Credential Management**: Keep AWS credentials secure and rotated
2. **Access Logging**: Monitor dashboard usage in production environments
3. **Resource Limits**: Set appropriate timeouts and query limits
4. **Audit Trail**: Track configuration changes and administrative actions

## Customization and Extension

### Adding Custom Metrics
```python
def custom_metric_query(client):
    return client.search(
        index="pdf_documents",
        body={
            "size": 0,
            "aggs": {
                "custom_aggregation": {
                    "terms": {"field": "custom_field"}
                }
            }
        }
    )
```

### Custom Visualizations
```python
def create_custom_chart(data):
    fig = px.bar(data, x='category', y='count')
    return fig
```
